# HW #2
You are given several files:
* main.c is your main file for the code
* test_builder is an application to build test files
* helper.h is a header file that is used to include libraries in both main.c and memory emulator (note the usage of include guards, please refer to the readings in the homework document for more details)
* fake_mem.o is an object file produced after compiling source code to emulate memory, you will need to link it to your code
* .travis.yml that is a script to perform tests in Travis CI

In this homework you need to create Makefile by yourself.

To refresh your knowledge about Makefile and gcc please refer to the readings from previous homeworks.

As usual we will grade your latest push taking into consideration your late days.

**Do not cheat** and good luck!
