# CSE320-Homeworks

This repository is an aggregate of all the most recent versions of the C based homeworks for CSE320.

Each homework will have a `README` describing what the goals of the homework were, and most will have documentation on the methods created within the homework, though I will include a basic summary of each homework here.

### HW0
  Basic introduction to the use and creation of our github homework folders.
### HW1
  Reimplementing string minipulation tools in C, as well as operating on a linked list and parsing input files.
### HW2
  Performing operations on simulated memory blocks.
### HW3
  Error checking using GBD in the main directory, and in `part2` taking user input to create new processes.
### HW4
  The main goal is to create a process that will take user input to launch new threads for user defined application locations. Part 1 is more process creation based on user input and using signals. Part 2 creates wrappers for memory minipulations methods in C that are thread safe. Part 3 creates methods that are used in thread creation.
### HW5
  Creating simulated memory and using that to build virtual and physical memory simulations
