Many of the bugs were not too difficult to find. 

The first thing I did was a preliminary compile of the code to see if it would run, and I found that on line 4, 'include' was misspelled. 

After that, I went through and found which libraries needed to be included, which were; string.h, sys/types.h, and unistd.h. 

After that the program compiled, and I attempted to run it, and was immediately exited with a segmentation fault. I stepped though the 
application with gdb and found that the fault was caused by the line "fscanf("%s", filename);" (line 58), as it was attempting to read in from stdin 
with fscanf instead of scanf to get the filename. The same error was present on the line "fscanf("%s", command);" (line 65), which I also changed.

I changed that and was then able to run the app, but when I attepted to generate the wallets it gave me another segmentation fault. 
So I went through the code again and found that in the "generate_wallets" method the app was trying to create 5000000 wallets instead 
of the num_wallets that was taken in by the file. To fix this, I changed the function so it took in the int num_wallets as an argument
and in the main I gave the method num_wallets.

After that all I had to do was build print_help.o to print_help after looking through it with gdb's dasassembly, and I realized that all it
was doing in the main method was calling 3 printf statements, as shown by the callq and the use of the %edi register. From what I have found, 
the %edi register is used specifically as a destination index used for string and memory array copying and setting.

And with that everything seemed to run perfectly, all of the commands worked, it took in the num.txt file, printed to the wallet_info.dat file
and read and printed the commands from the print_help application.

*Note: I changed line 69 (previously "execvp("./print_help", NULL);") and added "char* const args = {NULL};" while changeing "NULL" to "&args" as
I was recieving an error about passing NULL to execvp instead of a null terminated list of args.
